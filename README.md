==========

Plain is a protocol plugin for the Pidgin instant messenger.

The protocol is very simplistic. You can add buddies via an address
to send and receive plain text messages via UDP packets.

To provide secure communications you can use
the [OTR Plugin](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) on top of Plain.

###Future Plans

This is intended as a demo for [KadNode](https://github.com/mwarning/KadNode).

The project is currently in a alpha stage.
